        This document defines a signal, transmitted over HTTP and through the DOM, that conveys a
        person's request to websites and services to not sell or share their personal information with
        third parties. This standard is intended to work with existing and upcoming legal frameworks
        that render such requests enforceable.

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Building websites today often requires relying on services provided by businesses other than
        the one which a person choses to interact with. This result is a natural consequence of the
        increasing complexity of Web technology and of the division of labor between different
        services. While this architecture can be used in the service of better Web experiences,
        it can also be abused to violate privacy ([[?Privacy-Principles]]). While data can be shared
        with service providers for limited operational purposes, it can also be shared with third
        parties or used for behavioral targeting in ways that many users find objectionable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several legal frameworks exist — and more are on the way — within which people have the right
        to request that their privacy be protected, including requests that their data not be sold
        or shared beyond the business with which they intend to interact. Requiring that people
        manually express their rights for each and every site they visit is, however, impractical.
      </p>
      <blockquote cite="https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/privacy/ccpa-fsor.pdf">
        <p>
          Given the ease and frequency by which personal information is collected and sold when a
          consumer visits a website, consumers should have a similarly easy ability to request to
          opt-out globally. This regulation offers consumers a global choice to opt-out of the sale
          of personal information, as opposed to going website by website to make individual
          requests with each business each time they use a new browser or a new device.
          [[?CCPA-AG-FINAL-STATEMENT]]
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This specification addresses the issue by providing a way to signal, through an HTTP header
        or the DOM, a person's assertion of their applicable rights to prevent the sale of their data,
        the sharing of their data with third parties, and the use of their data for cross-site targeted
        advertising. This signal is equivalent, for example, to the "global privacy control" in the
        CCPA [[?CCPA-REGULATIONS]].
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>do-not-sell-or-share interaction</dfn> is an interaction with a website in which the
        person is requesting that their data not be sold to or shared with any party other than the
        one the person intends to interact with, or to have their data used for cross-site ad targeting,
        except as permitted by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <dfn data-lt="preference">do-not-sell-or-share preference</dfn> is when a person requests
        that their data "not be sold or shared" for instance by activating a Global Privacy Control
        setting with their user agent or by using tools that default to such a setting (possibly
        because this setting matches the most common expectations of that tool's users).
        When set, this [=preference=] indicates that the person expects to browse the Web with
        [=do-not-sell-or-share interactions=].
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Expressing a Do Not Sell Or Share Preference</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Expression Format</h3>
        <p>
          A Global Privacy Control [=preference=] needs to be conveyed to all mechanisms that might
          collect data from or share data with third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          If set, this [=preference=] is expressed as a single value of <code>1</code> or equivalently
          <code>true</code> according to context.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the absence of regulatory, legal, or other requirements, websites MAY interpret an
          expressed Global Privacy Control [=preference=] as they find most appropriate for the given
          person, particularly as considered in light of the person's privacy expectations, context, and
          cultural circumstances. Likewise, websites might make use of other [=preference=] information
          outside the scope of this protocol, such as site-specific person [=preferences=] or third-party
          registration services, to inform or adjust their behavior when no explicit [=preference=] is
          expressed via this protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
          User agents are expected to convey person [=preferences=] as accurately as they can. User
          agents SHOULD strive to represent what the user agent best believes to be the person's
          [=preference=] for the Global Privacy Control value.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Preference Caching</h3>
        <p>
          The [=preference=] MUST be cached on each top-level navigation to ensure consistency in communication of
          the person's request that their data "not be sold or shared." This means that if the [=preference=] changes
          during or after a top-level navigation, it will not be reflected until the next navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          A [=top-level browsing context=] has a <dfn><code>gpcAtNavigation</code></dfn> boolean.
          It is initially <code>false</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of [=gpcAtNavigation=] MUST reflect the [=preference=]
          of the person when the [=top-level browsing context=]'s [=navigable/active document=] began loading.
          It will be <code>true</code> if the person's  [=preference=] was enabled, and <code>false</code> if
          the person's [=preference=] was disabled or had not been set.
        </p>
        <p>
          If [=preference=] is changed to be inconsistent with some <code>gpcAtNavigation</code> cached in a
          [=top-level browsing context=], the user agent SHOULD inform the user of any inconsistent tabs and provide
          the option to reload them, refreshing the cached <code>gpcAtNavigation</code> to reflect the current [=preference=].
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>The <code>Sec-GPC</code> Header Field for HTTP Requests</h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn><code>Sec-GPC</code></dfn> header field is a mechanism for expressing the person's
          [=preference=] for a [=do-not-sell-or-share interaction=] in an HTTP request (for any
          request method).
        </p>
        <p>
          The syntax ([[ABNF]]) of the field is:
        </p>
        <pre class="hljs">
          Sec-GPC-field-name  = "Sec-GPC"
          Sec-GPC-field-value = "1"
        </pre>
        <p>
          A user agent MUST NOT generate a <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> header field if [=top-level browsing context=]'s
          <code>gpcAtNavigation</code> is <code>false</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A user agent MUST generate a <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> header field with a field-value that
          is exactly the numeric character "1" if [=top-level browsing context=]'s
          <code>gpcAtNavigation</code> is <code>true</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A user agent MUST NOT generate more than one <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> in a given HTTP
          request and MUST NOT use a <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> field in an HTTP trailer.
        </p>
        <p>
          A server processing an HTTP request that contains a <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> header MUST
          ignore it and process the request as if that header had not been specified unless the
          field value is exactly the character "1". If there are multiple <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code>
          headers and at least one has a field value of exactly "1" then the server MUST treat the
          request as if there were only one <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> header with a field value of
          "1"; and as if there were none otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTTP intermediaries MUST NOT remove a <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> header set to "1", but they
          MAY remove <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> headers that contain other values. Additionally, an
          HTTP intermediary that has reasons to believe the the person originating a given HTTP
          request has a [=do-not-sell-or-share preference=], MAY insert a <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code>
          header set to "1".
        </p>
        <aside class="example" title="Example GPC Request">
          <pre class="hljs http">
            GET /something/here HTTP/2
            Host: example.com

        <section>
          <h4>
            Extensibility of the Sec-GPC Field Value
          </h4>
          <p>
            The <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> is deliberately defined without an extension mechanism.
            Experience with previous similar headers shows that people tend to rely on string
            equality instead of parsing the value when testing for their presence, especially when
            extensions do not yet exist. Such checks would of course fail in the presence of
            extension content, which would in turn render the mechanism moot. Should extensions
            prove necessary to this standard, they will need to be implemented through other
            headers, which may in time supersede this one.

        <h2>JavaScript Property to Detect Preference</h2>
        <p>
          The {{GlobalPrivacyControl/globalPrivacyControl}} property enables a client-side
          script to determine what <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> header field value was sent when
          loading the [=top-level browsing context=]'s [=navigable/active document=].
        </p>
        <pre class="idl">
          interface mixin GlobalPrivacyControl {
            readonly attribute boolean globalPrivacyControl;
          };
          Navigator includes GlobalPrivacyControl;
          WorkerNavigator includes GlobalPrivacyControl;
        </pre>
        <p>
          The value is <code>false</code> if no <code>Sec-GPC</code> header field would be sent;
          otherwise, the value is <code>true</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of {{GlobalPrivacyControl/globalPrivacyControl}} MUST be the
          [=top-level browsing context=]'s <code>gpcAtNavigation</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The {{GlobalPrivacyControl/globalPrivacyControl}} property is available on the
          <code>navigator</code> object in both regular and worker contexts, and so can be checked
          reading from <code>navigator.globalPrivacyControl</code>.

      <h2>GPC Support Resource</h2>
      <p>
        A site MAY produce a resource at a .well-known URL in order for a site to represent the fact
        that it abides by GPC requests, at least where required to do so. The purpose of a GPC support
        resource is for a site to convey its awareness of and support for the Global Privacy Control.
        The support resource is not intended to convey whether the site abides by GPC requests from
        the user agent accessing the resource. By default, an origin's support is <em>unknown</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A GPC support resource has the well-known identifier <code>/.well-known/gpc.json</code>
        relative to the origin server's URL [[RFC8615]].
      </p>
      <p>
        An origin server that receives a valid GET request targeting its GPC support resource
        responds either with a successful response containing a machine-readable representation of
        the site-wide tracking status, as defined below, or a sequence of redirects that leads to
        such a representation (which MAY be provided by a server at another origin).
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>GPC Support Representation</h2>
        <p>
          The origin server MUST return the GPC support resource as a valid representation using the
          <code>application/json</code> media type [[RFC8259]], otherwise the origin's support is
          unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GPC support representation MUST be an
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259#section-4">JSON object</a>, otherwise the
          origin's support is unknown. Members of this JSON object not in the list below have no
          meaning in this specification and MUST be ignored. Members include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              A <code>gpc</code> member. The value of the <code>gpc</code> member MUST be either
              <code>true</code>, to indicate that the server intends to abide by GPC requests at least
              to the extent it is legally obligated to do so, or <code>false</code>, to indicate that
              it does not. For any other value the origin's support is unknown.
            </li>
            <li>
              A <code>lastUpdate</code> member. The value of the <code>lastUpdate</code>
              member MUST be an RFC3339 <code>full-date</code> (YYYY-MM-DD) or <code>date-time</code>
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ) [[RFC3339]]. This indicates the time at
              which the statement of support was made, such that later changes to the meaning of the
              GPC standard should not affect the interpretation of the resource for legal purposes.
              If the member is not in a valid RFC3339 format, the last update date and time is
              unknown.

      <h2>Legal Effects</h2>
      <p>
        Receiving a GPC signal may have legal effects, depending on
        factors such as the location of the individual sending the signal, the scope of the
        applicable law, as well as any separate agreement between the recipient of the signal and
        the individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the use of the GPC signal by an individual will be intended to communicate the
        individual's intention to invoke the following rights, as applicable:

            Under the CCPA, the GPC signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request
            from a global privacy control, as per [[?CCPA-REGULATIONS]] §999.315 for that browser or
            device, or, if known, the consumer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where the GPC signal conflicts with the existing privacy settings a consumer has with
            the business, the business shall respect the GPC signal but may notify the consumer of
            the conflict and give the consumer an opportunity to confirm the business-specific
            privacy setting or participation in the financial incentive program [[?CCPA-REGULATIONS]]
            §999.315(c)(2).

          The Colorado Privacy Act (CPA) gives consumers the legal right to opt out of both the sale
          of their information as well as the use of their data for cross-site targeted advertising,
          including through the use of “universal opt-out mechanisms that clearly communicate a
          consumer’s affirmative, freely given, and unambiguous choice to opt out.” Under the CPA, the
          GPC signal will be intended to communicate a request to opt out of both the sale of their
          personal information and the use of their personal information for targeted advertising.
        </li>
        <li>
          Similarly, the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CDPA) gives consumers separate opt-out rights
          for data sales and targeted advertising, including through an “authorized agent by way of,
          among other things, a technology, including, but not limited to, an Internet link or a
          browser setting, browser extension or global device setting.” Under the CDPA, the GPC signal
          will be intended to communicate a request to opt out of both the sale of their personal
          information and the use of their personal information for targeted advertising.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        GPC could potentially be used to indicate rights in other jurisdictions as well. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Under NRS 603A, a GPC signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell My Personal
            Information request [[?SB220]].
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The GDPR requires that "Natural persons should have control of their own personal data"
            ([[?GDPR]], Recital 7). The GPC signal is intended to convey a general request that data
            controllers limit the sale or sharing of the person's personal data to other data
            controllers ([[?GDPR]] Articles 7 &amp; 21). This request is expressed with every
            interaction that the user agent has with the server.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that this request is not meant to withdraw a person's consent to local storage as per
            the ePrivacy Directive ("cookie consent") ([[?EPRIVACY-DIRECTIVE]]) nor is it intended to
            object to direct marketing under legitimate interest ([[?GDPR]]).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>
           The DPA's goal is to "strengthen the control and personal autonomy of data subjects over their
           personal data" ([[?DPA]]). The GPC signal is intended to convey a general request that data
           controllers limit the sale or sharing of the person's personal data to other data controllers
           ([[?DPA]] Articles 23 &amp; 24). This request is expressed with every interaction that the user agent
           has with the server.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Other state privacy laws, such as those in Virginia and Utah, give consumers new opt-out
          rights around data sales and targeted advertising but are silent on the legal effect of
          global opt-out signals. Regulators enforcing those statutes may determine that a user
          activating a signal such as GPC may be sufficient to legally exercise opt-out rights in
          those jurisdictions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, GPC is not necessarily intended to invoke every new privacy right in every
        jurisdiction. For example, GPC is not intended to globally invoke data deletion rights on
        every website visited by the user. GPC is also not intended to limit a first party’s use of
        personal information within the first-party context (such as a publisher targeting ads to a
        user on its website based on that user’s previous activity on that same site). For that
        reason, GPC should not be interpreted as exercising the CCPA’s right to limit the use of
        sensitive information in a first-party context.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the complexities of existing consent frameworks, publishers who accept the GPC signal
        should disclose how they treat the GPC signal in that jurisdiction and how they deal with
        conflicts between the signal and other specific privacy choices that the person has already
        made directly with the publisher, including instances where third party sharing may be
        permitted such as sharing to service providers/processors, sharing at law or at the
        direction of the individual.

        <h2>User Interface Language</h2>
        <p>
          Studies have shown that people do not want their data sold or shared. However, in some
          jurisdictions they can only avail themselves of that [=preference=] by explicitly asserting
          control.
        </p>
        <p>
          User agents are expected, where required, to present all the appropriate notices to people
          to ensure that the rights they wish to avail themselves of are effectively binding.

      <h2 id="privacy">Privacy Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Exposing a user's preference (in the HTTP header field or <pre class="js">navigator</pre> object)
        potentially divides users into two groups in a way that might increase the information
        available for fingerprinting. This extra information is available unless the signal
        perfectly correlates with other signals. Depending on the browser and implementation, the GPC signal
        may impose a privacy cost, though one intended to be justified by the privacy benefit
        of sending the signal.

      <h2>Implementation Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        It is worth considering that a GPC signal will be attached to every HTTP request made to a
        given site. Rendering a page on the Web often requires making dozens such requests. As such
        it can prove impractical for GPC signals to trigger full-blown opt-out procedures with
        costly audit trails for every single GPC interaction as that will cause a large amount of
        processing, including for resources served from a content delivery network (CDN) that must
        be executed as efficiently as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regulations that intend to support GPC are encouraged to consider such implementation
        difficulties. One way of addressing them is to differentiate between user interface
        affordances given to people for the purpose of requesting a [=do-not-sell-or-share
        interaction=] [=preference=] to persist on the site, and the provision of a
        [=do-not-sell-or-share interaction=] signal the state of which is maintained with the
        user agent. In the latter case, the interaction can be processed as if the person had
        previously requested such a [=do-not-sell-or-share interaction=] [=preference=] and were
        interacting with that [=preference=] already active.
